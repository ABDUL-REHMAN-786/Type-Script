QUESTION # 12

Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/
// Store the names of friends in an array called names
const anames = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"];
// Print a personalized message to each person
console.log("Greetings to my friends:");
// Personalized message for the first friend
console.log(`Hello, ${anames[0]}! Have a great day!`);
// Personalized message for the second friend
console.log(`Hello, ${anames[1]}! Have a great day!`);
// Personalized message for the third friend
console.log(`Hello, ${anames[2]}! Have a great day!`);
// Personalized message for the fourth friend
console.log(`Hello, ${anames[3]}! Have a great day!`);
export {};
