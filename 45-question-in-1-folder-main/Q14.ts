// Declare an array named guestList of type string[], containing a list of guest names
let guestList: string[] = ["Hamza", "Usman", "Ayesha", "Areeba"];


// Iterate over each element of the guestList array using the forEach method
// For each guest in the array, log an invitation message to the console using string interpolation
